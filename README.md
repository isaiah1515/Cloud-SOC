# Building a SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Live Traffic)
![Cloud Honeynet / SOC](https://github.com/isaiah1515/Cloud-SOC/assets/142617629/4e0b1f43-e741-4181-a582-0b3e17c344fe)


## Introduction

In this lab, I build a honeynet in Azure and ingest log sources from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace, which is then used by Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. I gathered metrics for the insecure environment for 24 hours and after that I hardened the environment, applied security controls, and gathered metrics for another 24 hours. Here are some of the types so metrics that were gathered:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

## Architecture Before Hardening / Security Controls

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

The architecture of the honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

The "BEFORE" metrics:
All resources were originally deployed, exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open to any and all traffic. All other resources were deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet.

The "AFTER" metrics:
Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-03-15 17:04:29
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 19470
| Syslog                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 348
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 843

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this lab, a honeynet was built in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel then ingested the logs from a central repository which provided alerts, triggers and created incidents based off the data. After hardening the environment itâ€™s clear that the number of security events has reduced significantly. This project was a perfect hands-on learning experience to help better understand a real-world SOC environment.

*Please note that it is more than likely that more security events, alerts, and incidents would have been generated in a larger, enterprise environment.
